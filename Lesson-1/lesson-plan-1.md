## Lesson 1 - How do computers think? 

###Introduction

How do computers think?

In this lesson students will consider how computers and robots needs to follow a sequence of instructions to complete a task. 

### Learning Objectives

- Know that computers follow a sequence of instructions to make something happen.
- Debug an algorithm


### Learning Outcomes

**All students are able to**

- Know that computers run programs that are a sequence of instructions to make something happen. 
- Be able to write a simple program 


**Most students are able to:**

- Know that Python is a computer programming language.  
- Be able to write a simple Python Program, and explain the sequence it is following.

**Some stufents are able to:**

- Understand the limitations of computers in comparison with human intelligence when following a sequence of instructions. 


### Lesson Summary

- An introduction to the basic physical parts of a RPi
- A demonstration that the RPi can behave like a traditional computer application
- The first Python program

### Starter

Have a demonstration Raspberry Pi already connected and final chatting robot program running. Hold up an RPi board and ask the students what they think it is. Explain that it’s actually a computer and that in the coming lessons we’re going to do something special with it. Instead of running apps and games other people have created for us, we’re going to learn to write our own software - to make a robot that chats to us.




### Main Development

1. Start with all the parts of the Raspberry Pi on a table: keyboard, mouse, speaker, memory card, power supply, monitor, monitor cable and RPi itself. Ask the class to name and describe each component as you connect it to the RPi in front of the class. Finally, plug in the power and watch it boot up. An alternative to this demonstration is to leave out the memory card and try and boot it to no avail. It should then be possible to describe the memory card as something that contains instructions to tell the RPi how to start. The RPis should all be booted and sitting on the login prompt waiting for authentication.

2. Ask students to set up their Raspberry Pi equipment, turn it on and log into their Pi using the username `pi` and the password `raspberry`

	*Note that students will not see any text when typing the password but rest assured it is working. Why do you think this might be the case? Hint: What might happen if someone was looking over your shoulder?*
	
3. Next students should load the graphical user interface by typing `startx`. 	```

### Plenary


A computer works by executing statements one after another in a specific order. A given order of statements is called a **program**. Each program executes with a given **control flow** which describes which statement we are executing and what the next statement will be.

### Homework

Students should write a sequence of instructions for a task such as getting dressed for school or their favourite dance moves.
