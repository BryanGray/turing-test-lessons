Students will need access to heaphones in order to hear the sounds. You may also require a speaker to demonstrate to the class.


### Learning Objectives

- Be able to add code to our Python programs on the Raspberry Pi to allow text to speak.



### Learning Outcomes

**All students are able to**

- Be able to write a simple Python Program and check that it works.


**Most students are able to:**

- Know that Python is a computer programming language.  
- Be able to write a simple Python Program, and explain the sequence it is following.

**Some stufents are able to:**

- Understand the limitations of computers in comparison with human intelligence when following a sequence of instructions. 


### Lesson Summary

- The first Python program

### Starter

### Main Development

1. Ask students to set up their Raspberry Pi equipment, turn it on and log into their Pi using the username `pi` and the password `raspberry`

	*Note that students will not see any text when typing the password but rest assured it is working. Why do you think this might be the case? Hint: What might happen if someone was looking over your shoulder?*
