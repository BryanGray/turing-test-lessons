## The Turing Test

![](http://openclipart.org/image/800px/svg_to_png/60415/robot.png)

### Introduction

This scheme of work has been designed as an introduction to text based programming using Python on the Raspberry Pi. By the end of all the lessons students will have created an interactive chat bot and have been introduced to the computer science concept of artificial intelligence. 

This scheme of work is specifically targetted towards introductory KS2 Computing. Altough these lessons could be used as a wider scheme of work at KS3. This has been developed in harmony with the new Computing curriculum in the UK.


###Students will learn

Over the course of three lessons, students will learn:

- What a Raspberry Pi is, what are it's main features, and how to setup and use one.
- How to programme a Raspberry Pi to act as a chat robot.
- What is meant by artificial intelligence, in particular relating to the Turing Test.
- Computer Science concepts:
	- Sequencing
	- Algorithms
	- Debugging
	- User input
	- Print Statements


###Computing Programme of Study Met


**KS2:** 

- Design, write and debug programs that accomplish specific goals; solve problems by decomposing them into smaller parts. Select, use and combine a variety of software on a range of digital devices to design and create a range of programs. 
- use sequence, selection, and repetition in programs; work with variables and various forms of input and output
- use logical reasoning to explain how some simple algorithms work and to detect and correct errors in algorithms and programs

**KS3:**
 
- Use two or more programming languages, at least one of which is textual, to solve a variety of computational problems.

###Resources

For the majority of the lesson, it is suggested that work is carried out by students on a Raspberry Pi in pairs. Each pair should have access to the standard equipment described below:

- A Raspberry Pi per pair connected to a local network;
- Latest NOOBS SD card with the Sonic Pi software installed per pair;
- A keyboard and mouse connected to the RPi per pair;
- A monitor connected to the RPi per pair;
- A headphone splitter connected to the RPi audio jack per pair;
- A pair of headphones connected to the splitter per student.

*Note: These lessons will use Python 3 syntax*


###Lessons
