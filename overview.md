This scheme of work has been designed as an introduction to text-based programming using Python on the Raspberry Pi. By the end of all the lessons, students will have created an interactive chat bot and will have been introduced to the computer science concept of artificial intelligence.

This scheme of work is specifically targeted towards introductory KS2 Computing, although these lessons could be used as a wider scheme of work at KS3. This has been developed in harmony with the new Computing curriculum in the UK.
